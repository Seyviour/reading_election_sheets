# ENEL645 Final Project

In this project, we develop a model to effectively extract voting counts from the 2023 Nigerian election voting sheets, by fine-tuning pretrained vision language models, such as PaliGemma, a 3-Billion parameter vision-language model developed by Google, using LoRA to make the training process more efficient. Our work presents a promising tool for officers and citizens to verify election vote results and detect human errors, enhancing the credibility and transparency of elections. 

The PaliGemma training and inference codes are given in paligemma_vote.py and paligemma_vote_infer.py. Their output files are slurm-33416004.out and slurm-33424800.out, respectively.
